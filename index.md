			My research uses tools from Mathematics, Game Theory, and Computer Science. I work with continuous and discrete models, prove theoretical existence theorems and code efficient algorithms, and work with both dynamic online and static offlineÂ settings. I see my work as developing tools to provide new insights on situations involving uncertainty, and I am happy to hear about your problems.

			I joined LSE in 2025 as a Fellow in Mathematics.Â 
Before this, I completed my PhD under the supervision of <a href= "https://pub.ista.ac.at/~kchatterjee/">Krishnendu Chatterjee</a> at the <a href= "https://www.ista.ac.at">Institute of Science and Technology Austria</a> on the robustness of solutions in Game Theory, titled "Robustness of Solutions in Game Theory".
