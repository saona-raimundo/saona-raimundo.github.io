I presented my latest work on Revealing Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes, which was accepted to AAAI 2026.

## Title

Revelations in uncertain sequential decision making: from undecidable to EXPTIME

## Abstract

Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a central model for uncertainty in sequential decision making. 
The most basic objective is reachability: a target must be eventually visited.
The computational problems are: 
(a) almost-sure winning: reaching the target with probability 1;
(b) limit-sure winning: reaching the target with probability arbitrarily close to 1;
and (c) quantitative analysis: approximating the optimal probability of reaching the target.
For general POMDPs, almost-sure analysis is EXPTIME-complete, but limit-sure and quantitative analysis are undecidable.
A special class of POMDPs, called revealing POMDPs, has been studied recently in several works, where almost-sure analysis was shown to be EXPTIME-complete.
In this work, we show that for revealing POMDPs the limit-sure analysis is EXPTIME-complete, and the quantitative analysis is EXPTIME.


The presentation was on a whiteboard.
