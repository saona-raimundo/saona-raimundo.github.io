I presented part of my thesis regarding the stability of matrix games.

## Abstract

Rock-paper-scissors represents one of the most basic games, called Matrix Games. Players play simultaneously and, according to their actions, one player pays the other some payoff. We consider stability questions on Matrix Games: if the payoffs deviate slightly, is it beneficial for one player or the other? We formalize this idea, find the problem's complexity and connect it with problems arising in Linear Programming and Stochastic Games.
