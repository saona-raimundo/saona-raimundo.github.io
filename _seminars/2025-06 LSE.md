I presented my latest work on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes, on the complexity of reachability objectives under constant memory policies.

## Title

Computational complexity and strategy characterization for small memory policies in Partially Observable Sequential Decision Making

## Abstract

Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) model a controller interacting with an uncertain environment.
A fundamental objective is to reach a target state. 
The general problem is algorithmically impossible:
(1) Approximating the maximum probability the controller can guarantee to reach the target is undecidable.
(2) even deciding if the maximum guarantee is probability 1 or not is undecidable.
Therefore, we study the problem for constant memory policies.
Under this restriction, the problem was known to be in between NP and a fundamental problem in geometry.
Beyond explaining the computational complexity achieved, I will explain fundamental tools in logic and parameterized Markov Chains.
