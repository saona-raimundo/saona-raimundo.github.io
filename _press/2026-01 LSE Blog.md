I was the author of a blog featuring a professor! 

I interviewed Ryan Martin, a professor at Iowa State University, visiting the UK as a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Birmingham between September 2025 and June 2026. In November 2025, he gave a talk at our seminar on Combinatorics, Games and Optimisation.
