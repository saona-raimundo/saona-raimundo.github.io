I presented "Ergodic Unobservable MDPs: Decidability of Approximation" a talk based on my last submission to MOR (Mathematics of Operations Research) dealing with a subclass of blind MDPs (Probabilistic Finite Automata) where approximating the liminf average value is decidable and compuntig it exactly remains undecidable.

Here is the presentation:
