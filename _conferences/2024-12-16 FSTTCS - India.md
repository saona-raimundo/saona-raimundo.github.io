I presented "Concurrent Stochastic Games with
Stateful-discounted and Parity Objectives: Complexity and Algorithms" a talk based on my accepted paper in FSTTCS (Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science) dealing with the approximation of the limit value of concurrent stochastic games.

Here is the presentation:
