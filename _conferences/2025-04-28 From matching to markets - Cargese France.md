I presented the paper "IID Prophet Inequality with Random Horizon" which was recently accepted in ICALP 2025! 

I met new and old friends. The venue was amazing and the vibe of everyone makes me glad that I work in research.

I met a professor I did not know about before: Rakesh Vohra.
He was an amazing presenter and I hope we get to work together.

Here is my presentation:
