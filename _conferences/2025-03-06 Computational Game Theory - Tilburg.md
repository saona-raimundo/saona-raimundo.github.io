I presented "POMDPs and Blind MDPs: (Dis)continuity of Values and Strategies", the last part of my PhD thesis dealing with continuity properties in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes. This was the same topic I presented in Rome, but in a shorter talk.

I met some good friends in the event, including:
- [Rebecca Reiffenh√§user](https://reiffenhaeuser.de/)
- [Markus Utke](https://markus-utke.github.io/) 
- [Ulrike Schmidt-Kraepelin](https://sites.google.com/view/schmidt-kraepelin)
- [Tim Oosterwijk](https://sites.google.com/view/timoosterwijk/)

I made some new friends too, including:
- [Yurong Chen](https://ruyc.github.io/)
	- Postdoc at SIERRA-team, INRIA Paris, working with Michael I. Jordan.
	- Presented "Are Bounded Contracts Learnable and Approximately Optimal?"
- [Sai Ganesh Nagarajan](https://sites.google.com/view/sgnagarajan/home)
	- Postdoc and a thrust leader of the Robust and Explainable Learning Group at Zuse Institute Berlin which is under Prof. Sebastian Pokutta's group.
	- Presented "The Complexity of Two-Team Polymatrix Games with Independent Adversaries"
- [Arthur Dolgopolov](https://arthurdolgopolov.net/)
	- Post-doc at IMW, Uni Bielefeld 
	- Presented "Algebraic Approach to Competitive Equilibria"
- [Michael Heinrich Baumann](https://num.math.uni-bayreuth.de/en/team/michael-baumann/)
