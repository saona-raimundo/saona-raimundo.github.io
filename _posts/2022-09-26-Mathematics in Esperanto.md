Mathematics should be easy to access, have as few entry barriers as possible. Although mathematics uses its own language-independent symbols, a person needs explanations and motivations to understand most of the works. Therefore, an easy and international language is best suited to explain Mathematics. I propose to use Esperanto to explain Mathematics.

Esperanto is one of the largest and most mature human-made languages intended to be used as an auxiliary language. Here are some resources to use when writing Mathematics in Esperanto.
