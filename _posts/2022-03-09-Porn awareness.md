Sex is an important facet of life, it deserves to be openly discussed.

""Decades of studies from respected institutions have demonstrated significant impacts of porn consumption for individuals, relationships, and society."" (fightthenewdrug.org)

Sex and porn have been a taboo topics and there are special regulations for them. Do you want to start a real conversation? The resources I want to share and promote are:

- [Fight the new drug](https://fightthenewdrug.org/)
A non-religious and non-legislative organization that exists to provide individuals the opportunity to make an informed decision regarding pornography by raising awareness on its harmful effects using only science, facts, and personal accounts.

- [Brain Heart World](https://brainheartworld.org/)
A documentary by Fight the new drug, which is amazing!
