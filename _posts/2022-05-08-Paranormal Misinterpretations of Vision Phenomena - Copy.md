Since a very young age, I have been curious about aura and other vision phenomena that could "prove there is something more". Many of the vision phenomena are explained in [this paper](https://skepticalinquirer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2011/11/p44.pdf).

In a very brief summary, these are the explanations.
- Aura, glowing surrounding field.
	- Our eyes always move (even without us noticing)
	- They remark contrast
	- After images are produced with long exposure to a static image, simply because our receptor cells get used to the image
- Vitality Globules
	- Can be seen when you focus on the sky in a sunny day
	- It is your blood vessels in the inner eye
	- Different forms (small dot and long tails) come from the different cells in your blood (white and red respectively)

You can see the references therein if you want to look for more information.
