This post is heavily based on a course "Literature Research in Academic Databases" (provided at ISTA) to understand how to perform literature review in science including the use of Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus.
I have adapted it for my field of research.

## Academic Databases

**Definition.** An academic database is a searchable collection of academic literature. They provide access to a range of academic content, such as journal articles, conference proceedings, books, patents, technical reports and others.

**Example.**
- Web of Science
	- Comprehensive citation search
	- Cross-disciplinary
- SciFinder
    - Comprehensive for chemical literature
- Scopus
    - Contains abstract and citations of articles
- PubMed
    - Free
    - Life sciences and biomedical topics
    - Quality control before being indexed
- MathSciNet
	- From American Mathematical Society
	- Comprehensive in Mathematics

SciFinder: Produced by Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), SciFinder is the most comprehensive database for the chemical literature, searchable by topic, author, substances by name or CAS Registry Number. Itâ€™s a core research tool for chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, materials science, nanotechnology, physics, environmental science and other science and engineering disciplines.
