This post is heavily based on a course "Literature Research in Academic Databases" (provided at ISTA) to understand how to perform literature review in science including the use of Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus.
I have adapted it for my field of research.

## Introduction 

### Academic Databases

**Definition.** An academic database is a searchable collection of academic literature. They provide access to a range of academic content, such as journal articles, conference proceedings, books, patents, technical reports and others.

**Example.**
- Web of Science
	- Comprehensive citation search
	- Cross-disciplinary
- SciFinder
    - Comprehensive for chemical literature
- Scopus
    - Contains abstract and citations of articles
- PubMed
    - Free
    - Life sciences and biomedical topics
    - Quality control before being indexed
- MathSciNet
	- From American Mathematical Society
	- Comprehensive in Mathematics

Disclaimer: Many academic databases are not free to use. Try going through your institution if you have one.

### Search engines

While searching, remember you can use the following tools.
- Related articles
- Boolean connectors (AND, OR, NOT)
- Edit distance proximity (near, next, within)
- Restrictive search (use of quotation marks "")
- Regular expressions (using * or . as a wild character)

### Tips for searching

- General to specific: use less filters in the beginning.
- Consult different databases

## Google Scholar

**Characteristics.**

- Free to use
- Advanced search available
    * Quotation for exact match
    * Logical operators AND, OR, NOT
- Research might take between 6 and 12 months to be indexed
- "Cited by" feature to track research development
- Article versions available
- Mark articles
- Save searches (to make them later again)

**Limitations.**

- Indexing only: Journal Articles, Conference proceedings, Court opinions, Patents, Books, Book chapters & reviews
- Not catalogued by professionals

**Tips.**

- Results are influenced by your search history. If you need to, connect to google scholar without them being able to tell it is you.
- Mark articles and organize them in "libraries".

## Web of Science

**Characteristics.**

- Covers best life sciences, medicine, social sciences, arts, and humanities
- Curated by professional to include most relevant content and their sources
- Free author search
- Paid content and AI-guided search, with research institutions usually providing access
- Get notified on new results for a search
- Index is organized in collections (based on topic or year)
- Advanced search available
    * Quotation for exact match
    * Logical operators AND, OR, NOT
    * Distance oparator NEAR/x
    * Same address SAME

**Limitations.**

- Mostly paid
- Only curated content is included, not everything will be there

**Tips.**

- [Webinars](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/webinars/on-demand-webinars/) to help you use Web of Science.

## Scopus

**Characteristics.**

- Database contains only abstracts and citations
- It covers life sciences, social sciences, physical sciences, and health sciences
- Indexes journals, books, conference proceedings, and patents
    * Journals are yearly evaluated on 
        + [h-Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index) 
        + [CiteScore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CiteScore) 
        + SJR (SCImago Journal Rank) 
        + SNIP (source normalized impact per paper)
- Paid, with research institutions usually providing access
- You can
    * Search on a topic
    * Find author information, such as H-index, and lists of publications
    * Locate Impact metrics for a journal title using SNIP, SJR, and CiteScore
    * **Cited by** feature to track research development
    * Locate potential collaborators or subject experts
    * Set Citation Alerts
- [Video tutorials](https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14799/c/10545/supporthub/scopus/)
	- For example
		- assess an author's impact
		- keep track of an author
- Advanced search available
    * Logical operators AND, OR, AND NOT
    * Preceds by PRE/n
    * Within W/n

**Limitations.**

- Mostly paid

**Tips.**

- Try the "cited by" feature, alongside with google scholar's same feature
- Get historic citations on a topic by a simple search, displayed in different forms

## Metrics

Measuring the impact of journals, articles, and authors is not trivial.
Remember: metrics may not solve your particular problem, only give you some insights.

### Journals

Metrics available include
- SciteScore
	- Based on Scopus index only
	- Metrics for journals, articles, and researchers
	- Free to use
- SCImago Journal Rank (SCJ)
    - metric for journals, book series and conference proceedings
    - based on the subject field, quality and reputation 
- Source-Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP)
    - considers differences in disciplinary characteristics
    - may be used to compare journals in different fields
- Impact Factor
    - used as a proxy for the relative importance of a journal within its field

### Articles

Metrics available include
- Citations
- Field-weighted Citation Impact
- Altmetrics
    - based on online presence
    - track mentions of a work in social media
- Article Influence score
    - average influence of a journal's articles over the first five years after publications

### Authors

Metrics available include
- h-index 
    - measures productivity and citation impact of publications
    - depends on the index you search in
