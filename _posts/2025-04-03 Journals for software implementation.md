Where can I publish software implementation in academia? 

Before the list, remember to promote your work in the right network of people you want to reach. For example, to publish your package in the repository for that language, or make a blog in about it in the corresponding social network and advertise it in the pertinent newsletter.

- [International Congress on Mathematical Software](https://icms-conference.org/)
    - Mentioned by high-profile people, like Alicia Dickenstein
- [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/)
	- Very direct from implementation to publication
	- Need - Description - Example
	- 100% free
- [SoftwareX](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/softwarex)
	- Motivation - Description - Example
	- Similar to the Journal of Open Software 
	- Open access
- [ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software](https://dl.acm.org/journal/toms)
	- Closer to an academic paper, with details on choices during implementation and experiments
- [Numerical Algorithms](https://link.springer.com/journal/11075)
- [Mathematics of Computation](https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/)
