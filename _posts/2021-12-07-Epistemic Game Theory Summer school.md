I am going to attend the [Seventh EPICENTER Summer Course in Epistemic Game Theory 2022 <span>&#124;</span> EpiCenter](https://www.epicenter.name/summercourse/)!

## What is Epistemic Game Theory?

This fieldÂ takes a new, fresh approach to game theory, and studies how people *reason* in game theoretic situations before they eventually make a choice. More precisely, it explores how we reason about the *minds of others* before we make a choice. Hence, the reasoning of people like you and me is at the center stage of *epistemic game theory.* [from [EPICENTER](https://www.epicenter.name/) ].
