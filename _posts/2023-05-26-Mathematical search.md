# Mathematical browsing

How to browse mathematical content in the web? How to do it as a working mathematician?

## Resources

- [zbMathNew](www.zbMath.org) 
	- an abstracting and reviewing service in pure and applied mathematics
- [MathSciNet](www.ams.org/mathscinet) 
	- searchable database of reviews, abstracts and bibliographic information for much of the mathematical sciences literature
- [Google-Scholar](www.scholar.google.com)
	- search of scholarly literature across many disciplines and sources
- [Google](www.google.com) 
	- Search the world’s information, including web-pages, images, videos and more
- [TIB](www.tib.uni-hannover.de) 
	- The online catalogue of the Uni Hannover Library 
- [vifamath](vifamath.de) 
	- The Virtual Library of Mathematics” - a meta online catalogue
- [arXiv](www.arxiv.org) 
	- Open e-print archive
- [ResearchGate](www.researchgate.net) 
	- a network dedicated to science and research
- [mathoverflow](www.mathoverflow.net) 
	- a question and answer site for professional mathematicians
- [MSC-Map](www.map.mathweb.org) 
	- accessing math via interactive maps based on an MSC metric
- [arXiv-Catchup](www.arxiv.org/catchup) 
	- interface for catching up with the newest articles in math
- [FormulaSearch](www.zbmath.org/formulae) 
	- allows to search for mathematical formulae in documents indexed in zbMath

Also, recall that you have
- "myOffice" 
	- the personal office as math search interface —
- myLibrary 
	- a physical library known by the subject
- Bibliography 
	- a bibliography as math search interface
- myColleagues 
	- personal colleagues as math search interface
