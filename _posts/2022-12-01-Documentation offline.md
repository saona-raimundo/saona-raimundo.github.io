## Plurilingual

To get documentation of many languages in the same interface, check out [devdocs.io](https://devdocs.io). It can be used offline as Progressive Webapp.

## Rust

The command
```
rustup docs
```
gives you access to various documentations (including std with the `--std` flag).

Also, in your project, you can have all dependencies documentation by just running
```
cargo doc
```
