This is a meditation practice you can prerecord yourself to help you choose between plans for the future.
Enjoy!

## OPEN YOURSELF

<pre>
Imagine a road.
You walk through it.
You see the next intersection.
Feel the anxiety building up:
what will you choose?

Imagine you follow one option. 
You meet the people of this option.
Feel them and feel how you feel.
Feel what you do.

Go back.

Imagine you follow the other option. 
You meet the people of this option.
Feel them and feel how you feel.
Feel what you do.

Go back.

Notice a third option.
You did not see it before.
Imagine one you go in.
Feel how natural it feels.

Go back.

Choose a path to go.
Guide an energy ball through that path.
</pre>
