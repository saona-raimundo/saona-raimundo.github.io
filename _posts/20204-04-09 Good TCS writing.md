# Good exposition in Theoretical Computer Science

What makes a great article in Theoretical Computer Science?

- clarity of the exposition
- conceptual perspective
- exposition of the intuition
- reflections about the meaning of the results
- self-contained
- paints the bigger picture

To give an example, the introduction should always contain:
1. the problem
2. the contribution
3. the context (including related works)

## Examples

The following are examples recognized for their exposition.

### General

Authoritative Sources in a Hyperlinked Environment by Jon M. Kleinberg

Oded Goldreich's In a World of P=BPP

### Proof outline

"Undirected Connectivity in Log-Space" by Omer Reingold.

### Intuition

Entropy waves, the zig-zag graph product, and new constant-degree expanders conveys a lot of intuition about graph products and expander graphs and the ideas are accessible to anyone with basic knowledge of linear algebra.
