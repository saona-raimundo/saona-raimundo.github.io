This is my personal history about finding a job after my PhD.
It could serve as a reference on times, opportunities, and expectations.
I use it to keep opportunities in mind.
Opinions about cities and countries are recompilation of honest advice I got: they are neither my personal opinion nor the truth.

The major organization is by country, because it is an easy-to-remember feature.

## Australia

- They follow the global academic job market with most positions been released in September every year.
- The tenure track professorship is usually very short (2 years), so they expect candidates to have the full suite of experience.
- Prestigious universities are the "group of 8"
- About cities:
	- Mellbourne
		- Simply good.
	- Sydney
		- Very spread, lot of commuting
	- Brisbane
		- Not too pricey, nice, and simple
	- Perth
		- New, young and self-sufficient city.
	- Adelaide
		- People who want to retire go here. Usually, people are resilient to meet outsiders.
	- Canberra
		- Artificial city designated the capital, has no coast and there is little life outside work,

For postdocs, one should look into the awarded grants (October, November) and contact the professors directly as soon as possible (to show genuine interest), even before they open a position.
For research: [ARC Discovery](https://www.arc.gov.au/funding-research/discovery-linkage/discovery-program/discovery-projects).
For research and applications (usually include a postdoc position): [ARC Linkage](https://www.arc.gov.au/funding-research/funding-schemes/linkage-program).

In my case, a keyword to use is the field of "computational mathematics", "operations research", "algorithmic game theory".
