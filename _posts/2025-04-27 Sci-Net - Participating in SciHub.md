[Sci-Net](https://sci-net.xyz/) is <emph>the way<\emph> to participate in the SciHub initiative!
You are very much invited to participate in it.

## The idea

Ever wanted to ask for a paper behind a paywall to other researchers? 
What about sharing some papers with other that may not have access to them?
Or even better, have you ever wanted to make your research really easy to access?

First of all, SciHub is a great initiative that handled accessing papers by using credentials from other researchers whose institutions granted them unlimited access to many publishers.
SciHub has been very controversial... and the best tool I ever used!

The tool is simple: ask for a paper through their DOI (digital object identifier), and get the paper if it is in the database or SciHub can access it.
Now, we have a network to help SciHub in this task: Sci-Net.

In Sci-Net, you can ask everyone for a paper and someone else may upload the requested paper. 
This transaction is powered (and filtered) by using cryptocurrency which is, honestly, just symbolic.
Academia will most probably not make you rich, and uploading papers to the public domain either.
Once a paper is uploaded and reviewed by whoever asked for it, the file remains in SciHub database, accessible to everyone!

## How to participate?

Sci-Net uses cryptocurrency, so you have to make an initial (symbolic) investment to be part of it. I used 5 euros and this will last me for years.
To start, it was not straight forward, so I detail my steps.

1. Have a Revolut account.
- Revolut is an online bank, and it is very easy to open a bank account at no cost.

2. Put money in your Revolut account.
- This is a normal bank transfer because Revolut provides you with a normal bank account (it has an IBAN).

3. Within your Revolut account, buy the Solana cryptocurrency (SOL).
- There is a fee to pay here, and I am sure it is not the lowest fee there is out there.

4. Have a wallet in the Solflare plataform
- Solana is a blockhain platform (or network), SOL is a cryptocurrency, and Solflare is the first wallet in the Solana blockhain platform, where you can manage cryptocurrency.

5. Transfer SOL from your Revolut account to your Solflare wallet
- From Revolut, you can send cryptocurrency to many networks, including the Solana network.
- Within the Solana network, you can choose to send your SOL cryptocurrency to your wallet in Solflare.

6. Within your Solflare wallet, swap SOL cryptos for sci-hub cryptos (scihub)
- The `scihub` cryptocurrency is a community meme token.
- It is not an official Sci-Hub token, not affiliated with Sci-Hub, and does not own Sci-Hub.

7. Pay in `scihub` tokens to Sci-Net, and get your invitation code 
- You need `scihub` tokens to join Sci-Net.
- By adding `scihub` tokens (paying Sci-Net), you will get a code to join and your Sci-Net account will have these `scihub` tokens.

8. Participate in Sci-Net!
- After joining, your account will have as many tokens as you paid Sci-Net.
- Ask for papers putting token rewards, or upload papers that have been asked in the platform and get `scihub` tokens as a reward.
- Every paper uploaded will remain in Sci-Hub for public use, in the "public domain".

By the way, if you ever want, for some reason, to withdraw your `scihub` tokens from the Sci-Net platform, you can do it.
Then, you can swap again from `scihub` tokens to other crypts (for example, back to SOL cryptos).
Lastly, you may even go back to "real" money by selling cryptos.
