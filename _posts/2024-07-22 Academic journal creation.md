# Academic journal creation

We all know that the publishing industry could be improved.

In this post, we highlight our attention to a novel attempt by colleagues in the Graph Theory community.
They are launching a new journal.
The journal would sit quality-wise in between other two already stablished journals.
Notably, the journal is diamond open access: no charges for authors and no charges for readers.

Check it out on [its website](https://igt.centre-mersenne.org/), or read [an interview about its creation](https://www.centre-mersenne.org/en/interview-with-louis-esperet-on-the-creation-of-the-journal-innovations-in-graph-theory/).
