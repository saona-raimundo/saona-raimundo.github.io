I have always considered myself a citizen of the world. As I grow older, country boundaries make less sense. Under the current system, I wish people had the opportunity to choose their nationality and should not suffer for decisions they have (almost) nothing to do with. A more revolutionary friend would ask me why we need countries at all.
