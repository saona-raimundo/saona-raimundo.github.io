I participated in a project for the development of a fire forecasting model for the city of Valparaíso.

Cleaned and merged database from the firemen and The National Forest Corporation.

Worked in the design and coordination of the weather forecasting data with historical fire-data in order to achieve an online fire alarm  preventing system.
